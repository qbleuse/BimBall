Bim!Ball is a brutal 3D brawler plunged in the frenzy of AMERICAN FOOTBALL. In a WILD ARENA, you embody the unforgiving KNIGHTERBACK, an absolute BRUTE set to score a TOUCHDOWN
at any cost and END whoever would be on his way... Jostling among various enemies, an evolving LD and a compendium of juicy FXs, you shall master a unique dual combat system...
to decimate your enemies & WIN THE GAME!
